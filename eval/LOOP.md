# Visualize Improvement Loop (v7 — Clone & Pipeline)

The git repo (`https://github.com/kdongik-ops/visualize`) is the **source of truth**.
Every iteration clones the repo from GitHub, invokes the skill through Claude Code from inside that clone, evaluates real output with the automated pipeline, fixes the skill, and pushes improvements back.

The skill lives at `.claude/skills/visualize/`, so a clone is all it takes to load it — there is nothing to install and nothing to uninstall.

## Architecture

```

## Step 1: Clone Repo & Check State

```bash
WORK_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
cd "$WORK_DIR"
git clone https://github.com/kdongik-ops/visualize.git
```
This clone is both the state to read and the skill under test — exactly what a real user gets.
- Read `eval/loop-state.json`
- If gate is SHIP or VIRAL → report status, cleanup, exit
- If `loopsSinceResearch >= 5` AND score plateau → research phase

## Step 2: Generate (The Real Test)

Create a temp output directory, then work from **inside the clone** — Claude Code loads the skill from `.claude/skills/` in the working directory:
```bash
mkdir -p "$WORK_DIR/visualize/outputs"
cd "$WORK_DIR/visualize"   # MUST be here, or the skill will not load
```
Outputs go **inside** the clone. `claude -p` refuses to write outside its working
directory, so a path in `$WORK_DIR` itself would be rejected. The repo ignores
`*.html`, so the generated files never dirty the clone's git status.

Create a random persona with:
- Role (e.g., "VP of Sales at a B2B SaaS company")
- Situation (e.g., "preparing quarterly board update")
- Skill level (e.g., "non-technical, wants something impressive fast")

Generate 3-5 prompts they'd realistically type, plus 2-3 fixed prompts from `eval/stress-tests.md`.

For each test prompt:
```bash
claude -p \
  --allowedTools "Write,Read,Edit" \
  --model sonnet \
  "{test prompt}. Save as $WORK_DIR/visualize/outputs/{filename}.html"
```

**No install, no `--plugin-dir`.** The skill loads from `.claude/skills/` in the working directory, exactly like a user who cloned the repo. Give an absolute output path — outputs otherwise land in the repo root or `~/Downloads/`.

**Test prompt selection — always include:**
- 1 slide deck / presentation
- 1 dashboard with data
- 1 infographic / visual storytelling
- 1 non-English (Korean, Japanese, etc.)
- 1-2 rotating types (cheatsheet, comparison, flowchart, poster, carousel, timeline, etc.)

Save outputs to `eval/rounds/round-{N}/generated/`.

## Step 3: Evaluate — 3-Layer Pipeline

Run the automated eval pipeline (Layers 1 & 2):
```bash
cd "$WORK_DIR/visualize/eval/pipeline"
node run.js --dir "$WORK_DIR/visualize/outputs" --round {N}
```

This runs:
1. **Layer 1**: Format detection from DOM signals
2. **Layer 2**: 45 deterministic DOM checks (0-100 score)
3. **Screenshots**: Dark/light desktop + dark mobile captured

Results saved to `eval/rounds/round-{N}/scores.json`.
Screenshots saved to `eval/rounds/round-{N}/screenshots/`.

Then **you** (the agent) perform **Layer 3**: look at the screenshots and score 7 visual/IA dimensions using the calibrated prompt in `eval/pipeline/LOOP-PROMPT.md`:
1. First Impression (15%)
2. Typography (15%)
3. Color (10%)
4. Layout (15%)
5. Content (15%)
6. Information Architecture (20%)
7. Format Execution (10%)

**Calibration anchors (use these to stay consistent):**
| Score | Benchmark |
|-------|-----------|
| 10 | Apple.com product page |
| 9 | Stripe dashboard, Linear UI |
| 8 | Well-designed SaaS landing page |
| 7 | Decent Bootstrap template |
| 6 | Generic HTML template |
| 5 | Unstyled HTML with some CSS |

## Step 4: Analyze

Don't jump to fixes. Think first:
1. **Weakest dimensions** across all outputs (Layer 2 failing checks + Layer 3 low scores)
2. **Worst outputs** — which prompts produced bad results?
3. **Skill compliance** — did Claude Code actually follow SKILL.md? If not, WHY?
4. **Root cause** — trace every issue to a specific SKILL.md instruction (missing, unclear, wrong, buried, contradictory)
5. **Tag each fix:** `SKILL` / `REF:skeleton` / `REF:design-system` / `REF:other`

Write analysis to `eval/rounds/round-{N}/analysis.md`.

## Step 5: Fix SKILL.md + References

Work in the cloned repo from Step 1 (`$WORK_DIR/visualize`). Edits take effect on the next `claude -p` run — there is no republish step.

**SKILL.md (most important):**
- Add missing instructions with concrete examples
- Clarify vague instructions ("use 2rem" not "use appropriate sizing")
- Add anti-patterns ("DON'T: gradient text on headings")
- Simplify verbose instructions
- Make ignored instructions more prominent ("CRITICAL:" prefix)
- Keep under **5,000 words** — verify with `wc -w .claude/skills/visualize/SKILL.md`

**One rule, one place.** When an instruction already exists, edit that block. Never append
a second block stating the same rule elsewhere in the file.

**Fix the cause, not the symptom.** Read `consoleErrors` in `scores.json` first — the root
cause is usually written there verbatim. R50-R58 spent nine rounds appending 1,484 words of
Chart.js defensive code (`ChartManager`, `chartsBuilt`, guards, troubleshooting lists) to a
failure whose actual cause was one wrong CDN filename: `dist/chart.min.js` is the ESM build
and dies in a plain `<script>`. Commit `f01c7a1` fixed it in one line. The 1,484 words fixed
nothing and were deleted.

**References (priority order):**
1. `skeleton.md` — the HTML template, affects every output
2. `design-system.md` — typography, colors, spacing
3. `types.md`, `menu.md`, `libraries.md`, `css-techniques.md`

**Simplify everything:**
- Remove unused CSS rules
- Consolidate duplicates
- Replace JS with CSS where possible
- All top-level JS uses `var`

## Step 6: Push Fixes to Git

```bash
cd "$WORK_DIR/visualize"
git add -A
git commit -m "eval: round {N} fixes — {summary of SKILL.md changes}"
git push origin main
```

## Step 7: Re-generate (Verify Fixes)

Re-run the **worst 2-3 prompts** from Step 2. The fixes are already live in the clone:
```bash
mkdir -p "$WORK_DIR/visualize/outputs-fixed"
cd "$WORK_DIR/visualize"   # again: the skill loads from here
claude -p \
  --allowedTools "Write,Read,Edit" \
  --model sonnet \
  "{same prompt}. Save as $WORK_DIR/visualize/outputs-fixed/{filename}.html"
```
Compare before/after. Fixes should produce noticeably better output.

## Step 8: Validate

Run the pipeline again on re-generated files:
```bash
cd "$WORK_DIR/visualize/eval/pipeline"
node run.js --dir "$WORK_DIR/visualize/outputs-fixed" --round {N}
```

Verify:
- Layer 2 score improved
- Zero console errors
- Both dark and light themes work
- Hamburger menu works (toggle, download, print)
- If regression → revert, try different approach

Save post-fix screenshots to `eval/rounds/round-{N}/screenshots/`.

## Step 9: Commit Final Results & Push

Copy good re-generated outputs to `examples/` if they're better than existing ones:
```bash
cd "$WORK_DIR/visualize"
cp "$WORK_DIR/visualize/outputs-fixed/"*.html examples/
git add -A
git commit -m "eval: round {N} — avg {score} ({delta}), gate {GATE}

Key SKILL.md changes:
- {change 1}
- {change 2}

Generated via: claude -p (skill from clone, sonnet)
Weakest: {dim} ({score}), Strongest: {dim} ({score})"
git push origin main
```

Update `eval/loop-state.json` in this commit.

## Step 10: Cleanup & Report

```bash
# Delete temp directory — nothing was installed, so this is the whole cleanup
rm -rf "$WORK_DIR"
```

Output summary:
- Round number, persona, prompts
- Per-file scores (Layer 2 + Layer 3)
- Average score and delta from last round
- Top SKILL.md changes made
- Before/after for worst file
- Gate status
- Git commit hash

## Research Phase

Triggered when: `loopsSinceResearch >= 5` AND score plateau (< 0.3 improvement over 3 rounds).

1. Web search latest CSS/visualization techniques
2. Study award-winning designs (Stripe, Linear, Apple)
3. Analyze Gamma/Canva — what makes their output look professional?
4. Document in `eval/rounds/round-{N}/research.md`
5. Update SKILL.md + references
6. Reset `loopsSinceResearch = 0`
7. 30 minutes max, no rabbit holes

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Avg | Min | Meaning |
|------|-----|-----|---------|
| VIRAL | ≥ 9.5 | all ≥ 9 | Screenshot-worthy |
| SHIP | ≥ 9.0 | all ≥ 8 | Ready for public |
| ACCEPTABLE | ≥ 8.0 | all ≥ 7 | Functional, decent |
| NEEDS WORK | ≥ 7.0 | or any < 7 | Keep iterating |
| FAIL | < 7.0 | or any < 5 | Significant issues |

## Invariants (Never Break These)

1. Git repo always in working state
2. SKILL.md under 5,000 words — one rule stated in exactly one place
3. All top-level JS uses `var`
4. Class-based theming only (no @media prefers-color-scheme)
5. Content visible by default
6. Every fix goes into SKILL.md or references, not just individual files
7. Skill structure valid (`.claude/skills/visualize/SKILL.md` + `references/`)
8. **All evaluated outputs generated by invoking the skill, never hand-crafted**
9. **Skill always loaded from a fresh GitHub clone, never the dev working tree**
